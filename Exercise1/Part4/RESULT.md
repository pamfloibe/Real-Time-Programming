Before programming this, I thought this was going to return zeros every single time. Then, after trying it out and realising that I got a different number whenever I ran the program meant that I was wrong. I learned that when using multi-threading the functions "increase" and "decrease" would aim at the same global variable i. As concurrency was used, when both functions were called, whichever "pointed at" the variable first was going to overwrite it, even if both operations were made.
